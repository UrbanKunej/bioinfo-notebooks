Find a Profile-most Probable k-mer in a String :
    
    Given a profile matrix P, 
    we can evaluate the probability of every k-mer in a string S
    and find a Profile-most probable k-mer in S, 
    i.e., a k-mer that was most likely to have been generated
    by P among all k-mers in S.
    
    For example, ACGGGGATTACC is the Profile-most probable
    12-mer in GGTACGGGGATTACCT. Indeed, every other 12-mer 
    in this string has probability 0.

    In general, if there are multiple Profile-most probable k-mers in Text,
    then we select the first such k-mer occurring in Text.

Profile-most Probable k-mer Problem

    Find a Profile-most probable k-mer in a string.

    Given: A string Text, an integer k, and a 4 Ã— k matrix Profile.

    Return: A Profile-most probable k-mer in Text. (If multiple answers exist, you may return any one.)
