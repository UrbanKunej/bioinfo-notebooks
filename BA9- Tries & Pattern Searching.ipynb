    "The reason why the runtime of BruteForcePatternMatching is so high is that each string in Patterns must traverse all of Text independently. If you think about Text as a long road, then BruteForcePatternMatching is analogous to loading each pattern into its car when driving along Text, an inefficient strategy. Instead, our goal is to herd the patterns onto a bus so that we only need to make one trip from the beginning to the end of Text. In more formal terms, we would like to organize Patterns into a data structure to prevent multiple passes down Text and to reduce the runtime. To this end, we will consolidate Patterns into a directed tree called a trie (pronounced “try”), which is written Trie(Patterns) and has the following properties (see the figure on the next step).\n",

    "- The trie has a single root node with indegree 0, denoted *root*; all other nodes have indegree 1.  \n",
    "- Each edge of Trie(Patterns) is labeled with a letter of the alphabet.  \n",
    "- Edges leading out of a given node have distinct labels.  \n",
    "- Every string in Patterns is spelled out by concatenating the letters along some path from the root downward.  \n",
    "- Every path from the root to a leaf, or node with outdegree 0, spells a string from Patterns.  "

    "Although the suffix tree decreases memory requirements from O(|Text|2) to O(|Text|), on average it still requires about 20 times as much memory as Text (when the length of Text is on the order of the human genome). For a 3 GB human genome, 60 GB of RAM is a huge improvement over the 1 TB that we needed to work with a trie constructed for all reads, but it still presents a memory challenge for most machines. This reveals a dark secret of big-O notation, which is that it ignores constant factors. For long strings such as the human genome, we will need to pay attention to this constant factor, since the expression O(|Text|) applies to both an algorithm with 2 · |Text| memory and an algorithm with 1000 · |Text| memory.\n",
